This is a work inspired from [r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/e2zv4w/i_wrote_a_python_script_that_generates_a_geo/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)
just takes the location JSON and reads into a pandas dataframe and builds a heatmap using the folium library on openstreetmap

Didn't add the location heatmap HTML file as I don't want the same to be public :)
